# Setting Up Milk Toast Taco!

after you have installed MTT you likely want to play it right?
**(if you dont... uhh.. thats confusing but ok :D)**

### But if that is the case, heres how you do it!

1. First, you are going to want to find the location you installed milk toast taco to (Usually `yourmaindrive/Milk Toast Taco`)
  
2. then, inside there, you should be able to find a file called `milk_toast_taco.exe`, this is the main executible file for MTT that you should use when you launch MTT **(If you have the MTT launcher, you can launch it from there!)**
  
3. double click on the `milk_toast_taco.exe` file to run it, depending on your version of MTT this might be diffrent, but for the most part, a window should open, and if it does, this means you have installed MTT and it is working correctly!
  
4. Once at the MTT main menu, you can go to the `options` menu, and configure the grathical and gameplay settings to your liking.
  you can also go to the `general` tab in the options menu, and find the `"load preset"` area, where you can load json files from other people with custom option presets!
