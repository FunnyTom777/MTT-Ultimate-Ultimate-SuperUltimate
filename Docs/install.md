### Installing Milk Toast Taco!

**PLEASE NOTE!: MTT, at least for the time being, is WINDOWS OS ONLY!**  
(unless someone crazy feels like porting it to Linux somehow :D)

1. Download the latest `mtt_installer.exe` from the releses tab on the github repo.
2. Open File Explorer and navigate to a good location (recommended locations are in *your PC > your main drive*, or another drive). At that location, create a new `"Milk Toast Taco"` folder.  
  (The name can be whatever you want, but we recommend `"Milk Toast Taco"` for ease of finding it.)
3. When you have created that MTT folder, drag your newly downloaded `mtt_installer.exe` into it, and run the installer EXE.
4. The installer will prompt you to pick an installation option. These can vary depending on your MTT version, but for most users the `Recommended` option is best.
5. After you select your installation option, the installer will go ahead and begin installing MTT.  
  If you encounter any issues while installing, please read the FAQ page for assistance, or input your error code into the **debugging tool** on the official MTT website (imagine there's a link here :D).
6. After installation, the installer window will close.  
  You can confirm MTT's installation by right-clicking an empty space in the MTT installation folder (in File Explorer), selecting **Open In Terminal**, and running:
