3. When you have created that MTT folder, drag your newly downloaded "mtt_installer.exe" into that new mtt folder, and run the installer exe.
4. the installer will prompt you to pick a installation option, these can vary depending on your MTT version but for most users the "Recomended" option is best.
5. after you select your installation option, the installer will go ahead and begin installing MTT, if you encounter any issues while installing, please read the FAQ page for assistance, or input your error code into the "debugging" tool on the official MTT website: {imagine theres a link here :D}
6. after installation, the installer window will close, and you can confirm MTT's installation by rightclicking a empty space in the MTT file location (in file explorer), and selecting "Open In Terminal", and run `milktoasttaco --version`

**UPDATING MTT INSTALLATION:**
1. Open the MTT manager (`mttmanager.exe` in your mtt instalation folder) app.
2. inside the MTT manager app, navigate to the `options` section on the left sidebar, and then to the `updates` section.
3. when in the `updates` section, there should be a input feild and a few buttons, in the input feild labbeled `update link`, paste a MTT update github code, these codes can be found on the MTT website or in `updates.md` in this github repo.
4. then, press `update` and it should start updating your MTT installation.
> Note: it is recomended you backup your MTT data before updating, just incase the update breaks your data, though this is unlikely, its better to be safe than [sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apology_(act))! :D
